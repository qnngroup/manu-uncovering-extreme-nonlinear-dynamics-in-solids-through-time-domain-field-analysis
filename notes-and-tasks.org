** 220814 -- Updating Sampling Plots

I am pretty happy now with the sampling plots.

I realized if we are going proof of concept, I shouldn't restrict myself to a super short 2-um pulse, but I should make it short enough to reduce the amount of needed explanation about the sampling.

I now simulate the response with a driver having:
 - 2-um center frequency
 - 15 fs duration (Gaussian FWHM)
 - Peak field of 7 GV/m

Then we compare in the time-domain the sampled fields and gabor transforms to indicate that all salient features of the time-frequency information up to the 9th harmonic should be able to be captured.

The only issue remaining is the plasmonic response of the material, but I think this can be overcome with further engineering.
